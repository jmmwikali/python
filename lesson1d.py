# Create a python program that is able to calculate the simple interest given the principle as 50000, rate as 5% and time as 8 years. Simple interest = (P * R * T)/100

principle = 50000
rate = 5
time = 8
simple_interest = (principle * rate * time) / 100
print("Simple interest is:", simple_interest)
